# prepare.sh Roadmaps

Welcome to the prepare.sh roadmaps repository! This is where we maintain our learning paths for different technical categories, helping learners navigate their way through various technology stacks.

## About the Roadmaps

Our roadmaps are available at `prepare.sh/roadmap/<category>` and are designed to provide clear, structured learning paths for different technical domains. Each roadmap breaks down complex subjects into manageable steps with associated hands-on labs.

## Structure

Each roadmap consists of sequential steps, where each step:
- Has a clear name and description
- Contains a list of associated labs
- Focuses on specific learning outcomes

## Labs

Labs are identified by unique IDs in the format:
```json
{
  "$oid": "673156fa580b9cb5aa043e2a"
}
```

### Creating Labs

1. Sign in to [prepare.sh](https://prepare.sh)
2. Navigate to the lab creation page at `https://prepare.sh/createdlabs`
3. Create your lab content
4. Submit for review
