# prepare.sh Roadmaps

Welcome to the prepare.sh roadmaps repository! This is where we maintain our learning paths for different technical categories, helping learners navigate their way through various technology stacks.

## About the Roadmaps

Our roadmaps are available at `prepare.sh/roadmap/<category>` and are designed to provide clear, structured learning paths for different technical domains. Each roadmap breaks down complex subjects into manageable steps and tries to associated them with hands-on courses.

## Structure

Each roadmap consists of sequential steps, where each step:
- Has a clear name and description
- Contains a list of associated courses
- Focuses on specific learning outcomes

## Courses

Courses are identified by name in the Labs field in the format:
```json
["Course name", "Course 2 name"..]
```

If we have relevant courses on the website matching this course we will link a URL to it, otherwise it will be a placeholder

### Creating Labs/Courses

If you want to contribute by creating labs/courses to make sure your entry leads to a learning material Here's how:

1. Sign in to [prepare.sh](https://prepare.sh)
